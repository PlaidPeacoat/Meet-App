## Meet-App

Meet App allows users to search for a city and get a list of events hosted in that city (or events in all cities). One chart shows how many events will take place in that city on upcoming days and another visualizes the popularity of event genres in the form of a pie chart. It is a progressive web application built with React using test-driven development (TDD) technique. The app works offline and it can be installed on both mobile devices and computers. Serverless functions are used(AWS Lambda) for the authorization server which generates authorization token(OAuth 2 token) needed in order to access the Google Calendar API and get events data. Scatter chart and pie chart are implemented to visualize data using the recharts library.
